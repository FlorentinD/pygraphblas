GraphBLAS for Python

# Summary

pygraphblas is a python extension that bridges
[The GraphBLAS API](http://graphblas.org) with the
[Python](https://python.org) programming language.

GraphBLAS is a sparse linear algebra API optimized for processing
graphs encoded as sparse matrices and vectors.  In addition to common
real/integer matrix algebra operations, GraphBLAS supports up to 960
different "semiring" algebra operations, that can be used as basic
building blocks to implement a wide variety of graph algorithms.

pygraphblas leverages the expertise in the field of sparse matrix
programming by [The GraphBLAS Forum](http://graphblas.org) and uses
the
[SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/GraphBLAS.html)
API implementation. SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is brought to us by the work
of [Dr. Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html),
professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
Texas A&M University.
