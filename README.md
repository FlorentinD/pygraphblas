# pygraphblas

GraphBLAS for Python

# Summary

pygraphblas is a python extension that bridges [The GraphBLAS
API](http://graphblas.org) with the [Python](https://python.org)
programming language.

GraphBLAS is a sparse linear algebra API optimized for processing
graphs encoded as sparse matrices and vectors.  In addition to common
real/integer matrix algebra operations, GraphBLAS supports up to 960
different "semiring" algebra operations, that can be used as basic
building blocks to implement a wide variety of graph algorithms.

pygraphblas leverages the expertise in the field of sparse matrix
programming by [The GraphBLAS Forum](http://graphblas.org) and uses
the
[SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/GraphBLAS.html)
API implementation. SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is brought to us by the work
of [Dr. Tim Davis](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html),
professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
Texas A&M University.  [News and
information](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/news.html) can provide
you with a lot more background information, in addition to the

# Intro

For a long time, mathematicians have known that matrices are powerful
representations of graphs, as described [in this mathmatical
introduction to
GraphBLAS](http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/GraphBLAS/GraphBLAS-Math-release.pdf)
by [Dr. Jermey Kepner](http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/) head and founder
of [MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing
Center](http://news.mit.edu/2016/lincoln-laboratory-establishes-supercomputing-center-0511).

As Kepner's paper describes, there are two useful matrix
representations of graphs: [Adjacency
Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) and
[Incidence Matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix).
For this introduction we will focus on the adjacency type as they are
simpler, but the same ideas apply to both, both are suported by
GraphBLAS, and it is easy to switch back and forth between them.
